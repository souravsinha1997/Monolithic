# Monolithic
A monolithic version of an e-commerce application designed for managing products, orders, and user interactions in a single Spring Boot service. This project is a simplified version of my earlier microservices-based E-Commerce System, built to demonstrate how the same functionality can be achieved with a monolithic architecture.
